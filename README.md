# Welcome to PortalAlunos project!

Hi, this is an application project developed specifically for students at the "Baixada Santista" of São Paulo's technology college ([FATEC-BS Rubens Lara](https://fatecrl.edu.br/)).

The purpose of the application is to serve as a self-management tool for students' academic activities.

Its development is also carried out by a group of students from the institution and serves as a course completion work. So, it is submitted as a partial requirement of the Internet Systems ([Sistemas para Internet](https://fatecrl.edu.br/cursos/sistemas-para-internet)) course.

This is the repository to the front-end part of the system, made mainly with React Native. To consult the back-end part, [visit this respository](https://github.com/StephanGuter/PortalAlunosAPI).
